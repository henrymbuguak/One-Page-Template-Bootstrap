H-Lab is a Single Page WebSite Template created using Twitter Bootstrap. The Template is
fully responsive and thus can be change to fit the needs of your project. Bootstrap is 
all about classes and if you can remember them, you can design anything.

H-Lab Template has the following features:
         
Fixed Navigation bar
            This navigation stays stationary thus you can access any part of the site with
            ease. The template focus on the usability of the site. You can click any link 
            at the navigation and you are automatically taken there.
            
Jumbotron
         The template also uses Jumbotron and H-Lab has used an image in the Jumbotron as a
         background. The image has been made responsive thus good for small screens. The text
         color in Jumbotron also is transformed automatically to white color.
         
Carousel
        The template also uses carousel for cool image sliding. Carousel is class in 
        bootstrap that helps create image slider. If you decide to use this class you must make sure 
        that the image that goes to the slider are all of the same size.
